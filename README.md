Inventory Management System

## Concept Note

### Project Description: 
This is a software application designed to manage the inventory of shoes in a store 
or a shoe company. It is aimed at streamlining the process of tracking, managing, 
and organizing the stock of different types of shoes.

### Project Rationale:
Inventory Management can be a hefty task for small and medium enterprise 
businesses in different sectors, since they mainly resort to manual inventory 
management. This is prone to errors and inefficiencies which can lead to over or 
understocking of products. Furthermore, without a proper system in place, it can 
be challenging to track sales trends and make informed decisions about which 
products to stock up on.
Our system aims to address these challenges by providing detailed shoe(s) 
information such as sales, stock level management, supplier alerts all in real time.
This will help our customers make informed decisions regarding day-to-day 
operations and better effectively improve their businesses
